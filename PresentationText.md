â€¢	Hi, this is Sharon.
June 20 has been designated World Refugee Day, and the topic of my final map is the geo-visualization of child refugees in this country and around the world.
Specifically, it represents the percentage of child refugees, as a component of the total number of refugees, based upon their country of asylum.
I first considered this topic after an airplane discussion I had with a man returning from the Himalayas where he works for an NGO addressing womanâ€™s and childrenâ€™s issues.
The question of refugees and migrants is an important one today as global conflicts have displaced hundreds of thousands, and climate change is expected to displace potentially millions more.
Unfortunately, people are often poorly informed on the facts.
Does the available data support the popular rhetoric in this country and abroad?
In order to make an informed decision, we need to establish such basic facts such as the percentage of child refugees in the world, by country.
This map depicts the percentage of refugees under 18 years of age based on their country of asylum.
I hope the map helps people to better understand the facts surrounding refugees and migrants, and in particular, child refugees, and I also hope that users might gain new insights by seeing the data represented spatially.
â€¢	I hope that the map will be informative across a range of expertise levels.
I envision the target users for this map to include the general public who are curious about the immigration issues they see in the media, public policy and immigration advocates, and NGOâ€™s.
Immigration data can also help advocates of all types to better determine how best to allocate limited resources.
People need good information to have informed opinions.
This map would help to provide the critical data needed to guide decision-making in a format that would appeal to a variety of users, and especially those who prefer their information spatially.
Because as we all know, everything is better with maps ðŸ˜‰
â€¢	Weâ€™re looking at the Beta version of my chloropleth map depicting all of the worldâ€™s countries.
The map was created using CARTO Builder and Leaflet libraries, using the sequential color scheme BlueYellow in 7 classes.
The .csv data is hosted on CARTO, and because the data contained the ISO country code, it was able to be automatically geocoded by CARTO using the guessing functionality.
The users experience starts being drawn to the title and subtitle blocks, which are followed by additional general information on the topic of refugees.
The information is derived from the United Nations High Commission on Refugees Report for 2015, and there are clickable links that open new tabs for the UN High Commission on Refugees Report, as well as the Child Migration and Displacement page of the United Nations International Childrenâ€™s Emergency Fund, which we are familiar with as UNICEF.
The maps user interaction provides the standard zoom interface in the top left corner as well as the scroll wheel functionality on the mouse.
As you move to the next item in the hierarchy, you can create or remove a legend in the bottom right corner of the map using the tool on the top right; removing the legend could potentially be useful if the legend is obscuring the information.
The various color shades depict the percentage of child refugees seeking asylum per country, children are defined in this dataset as being under 18 years of age.
The darker the shading, the higher the percentage of child refugees.
The percentage of refugees that are comprised of children varies from a low of zero percent to a high of 66%.
The data I have also includes information regarding the percentage of children that have left each country, (their country of origin) and I hope to incorporate that into my final map.
â€¢	My wish list for this final week is to include additional layers of information, especially the overall numbers of refugees as a whole.
I still need to tighten up the code for the information panels, as well.
In addition, I would like to label the countries with their ISO country code, as the zoom level increases.  The ISO Code is a standardized abbreviation for each country, that was used by CARTO to geocode the data.
And for experts using the map, clicking on an individual country would provide an info window, which would include a synopsis of all the data for that country in text form.
I am hoping that even this basic information, visualized on a web map, with an interactive design, can help to better guide the discussion concerning the ongoing child refugee crisis.
Thanks in advance for your suggestions, Iâ€™m looking forward to seeing all your maps.
